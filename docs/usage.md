## Example Analyses

### Fraud Example

```
Message: "Congratulations! You've won $1,000,000 in our lottery! Click this link to claim your prize: [suspicious-link.com]. You just need to pay a small processing fee of $500 first."

Result:
ðŸš¨ FRAUD DETECTED
85% Fraud Probability

Reasoning: This message contains classic lottery scam indicators including unexpected winnings, requests for payment to receive prize, and suspicious links.
```

### Legitimate Example

```
Message: "Hi John, just wanted to confirm our meeting tomorrow at 2 PM in Conference Room B. Looking forward to it!"

Result:
âœ… SEEMS LEGITIMATE
15% Fraud Probability

Reasoning: This appears to be a normal workplace communication with no fraud indicators present.
```

## Performance Considerations

### GPU vs CPU Performance

- **GPU (CUDA)**: 2-3 seconds per analysis
- **CPU**: 10-15 seconds per analysis

### Memory Usage

The application typically uses 4-6GB of RAM during operation. Ensure your system has sufficient free memory.

## Best Practices

1. **Provide Complete Messages**: Include the full text for most accurate analysis
2. **Check Regularly**: Analyze suspicious messages immediately when received
3. **Verify Results**: Use the system as one tool among many for fraud detection
4. **Report Scams**: Report confirmed fraud attempts to appropriate authorities

## Privacy and Security
